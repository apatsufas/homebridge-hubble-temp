# homebridge-hubble-temp

Motorola baby monitor temperature plugin for [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

Adds a temperature sensor accessory to Homekit, with same temperature value as can be seen in Hubble app.

Tested with:

- Motorola MBP-845 Connect camera

## Installation

1. Install homebridge
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g https://github.com/apatsufas/homebridge-hubble-temp.git` (this package is not yet available on NPM)
3. Update your Homebridge configuration file (`config.json`)

## Configuration

The available fields in the config.json file are:
 - `accessory` [required] Always "HubbleCameraTemp"
 - `name` [required] Descriptive name of virtual device
 - `host` [required] Camera IP or host name on the local network. Note that this host must be reachable from the HomeBridge instance.
 - `update_interval`: [optional] Defines the polling period in seconds for the temperature value (default is 60s)

Example:

```
"accessories": [
    {
        "accessory": "HubbleCameraTemp",
        "name": "Baby room temperature",
        "host": "192.168.1.10",
        "update_interval": 60
    }    
]
```

## How does it work?

The plugin polls this camera endpoint:

```
http://[host]/?action=command&command=value_temperature
```

Example response from this endpoint:

```http
